#LIRI Bot#

This application provides information about songs, movies, and concerts. Instead of using different applications for each task, we combined it to do all tasks in one app!

This application has four commands that the user can enter: concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, do-what-it-says.

Command Line Format: node liri.js <enter command> <enter subject>

##concert-this##

This command will return information about bands performing concerts. It will give you the name of the venue, venue location, and date of the event.
